## Description

The Projectile Animation program is a simple projectile motion simulation with a launcher that can shoot projectiles towards a target. The goal is to hit the target accurately within a limited number of shots.

## Features

- Adjustable launcher angle and velocity using arrow keys.
- Fire projectiles using the 'f' key.
- Limited number of shots to make the simulation challenging.
- Target visualization for aiming.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Use arrow keys to adjust the launcher angle and velocity.
3. Press 'f' to fire a projectile.
4. Try to hit the target accurately within the limited number of shots.

## Controls

- **Up Arrow:** Increase launcher angle.
- **Down Arrow:** Decrease launcher angle.
- **Right Arrow:** Increase launcher velocity.
- **Left Arrow:** Decrease launcher velocity.
- **'f':** Fire a projectile.

## Exit

- Press 'q' or 'Q' to exit the program.

## Report

- At the end of the simulation, a report is displayed showing the total number of shots, misses, hits, hit percentage, and a grade based on the hit percentage.
